# Team Builder

## The Task

The task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application isn't deployed, a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing will be included below. 

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:

## Getting Started

A video submission, [Npm run tests and node.js video of the application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkJjHKi-dQpWkEl8tx9aLnMPj-tPKw5V/view?usp=sharing).
The application uses [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

* A sample HTML file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
